Code Review for [Student's Name]

Hi there! I had a chance to review the code you wrote and I must say that you did a great job!

Your code is well-structured, easy to read and follow, good job regarding the style of your code. I can see that you have a good understanding of basic programming concepts like functions and loops.

However, there are a few areas that could use some improvement that can easily be fixed. For instance, your class name on line 1 should start with a capital letter to stick to Java's naming conventions.

In the reverse_string function, the method name on line 18 and the method call on line 26 don't match. You can fix this by renaming the method call to match the method name.

The function method on line 28 with the generic parameter 'T' which is not being used, I would suggest removing it. 

Also, in the function method on line 28, you have declared the maxNumber parameter twice, the first time on line 28 and the next on line 30, which is causing a compilation error. You can remove the declaration inside the method since it's already declared as a parameter.

The 'function' method was not being called so it would not run the Fibbonaci sequence, I would suggest calling the method in the 'method' main.

Overall, your code shows great potential and I encourage you to keep practicing and exploring new concepts. Keep up the good work!
